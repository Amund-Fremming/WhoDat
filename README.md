# Who Dat?

The application is inspired by the classic game "Guess Who?" and introduces a unique twist by integrating personalized gameplay.
The game boards utilized during play are curated directly from the user's own gallery, a dedicated space within the app where
users can add and manage cards, each bearing a name for future gameplay.

In addition to the customizable gallery feature, our app is equipped with a selection of pre-designed cards, offering players
a variety of options to enhance their gaming experience from the outset.

Designed as a multiplayer platform, our application facilitates seamless interaction among users. Participants have the ability
to either join existing games or initiate new ones. The creator of a game is assigned a unique game ID, which can be shared
with any other player they wish to invite.
